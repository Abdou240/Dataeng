Here’s a simplified breakdown of your end-to-end data pipeline:  

### **1. Data Ingestion (Batch Processing)**  
- **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)** → Stores raw data.  
- **Terraform** → Provisions infrastructure (GCS, BigQuery, Airflow).  
- **Docker** → Containerizes the pipeline.  
- **Apache Airflow** → Orchestrates batch processing.  

### **2. Data Processing**  
- **PySpark** → Cleans and processes raw data.  
- **Airflow DAG** → Moves processed data to BigQuery.  

### **3. Data Warehousing**  
- **Google BigQuery** → Stores structured, partitioned, and clustered data.  

### **4. Data Transformation**  
- **dbt (Data Build Tool)** → Applies SQL-based transformations on BigQuery.  

### **5. Data Visualization**  
- **Power BI** → Connects to BigQuery and creates dashboards.  

### **6. Infrastructure as Code**  
- **Terraform** → Deploys and manages the infrastructure.  

Here’s a **detailed explanation** of each step in your **end-to-end data pipeline** using GCP and modern data tools:

---

## **1. Data Ingestion (Batch Processing)**
This is the first step where raw data is collected and stored before processing.

- **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**:  
  - Acts as a **data lake** where raw files (CSV, JSON, Parquet, etc.) are stored.  
  - You can upload data manually or automate it via scripts/API.  

- **Terraform (Infrastructure as Code - IaC)**:  
  - Automates the provisioning of GCP resources like **GCS, BigQuery, and Airflow**.  
  - Ensures infrastructure is reproducible and version-controlled.  

- **Docker (Containerization)**:  
  - Packages applications and dependencies into **containers** for consistency across environments.  
  - Helps deploy Airflow, PySpark jobs, and dbt in an isolated environment.  

- **Apache Airflow (Workflow Orchestration)**:  
  - Manages and schedules batch jobs using **DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs)**.  
  - Defines steps like:  
    1. Extract data from **GCS**.  
    2. Process it using **PySpark**.  
    3. Load it into **BigQuery**.  

---

## **2. Data Processing**
After ingestion, data needs cleaning and transformation before storage.

- **PySpark (Batch Processing Framework)**:  
  - Runs distributed processing for large datasets.  
  - Performs data cleaning, filtering, aggregation, and transformations.  
  - Converts raw data into structured format before loading into BigQuery.  

- **Airflow DAGs (Task Automation)**:  
  - Automates PySpark processing.  
  - Moves processed data from GCS to BigQuery in an **ETL pipeline**.  

---

## **3. Data Warehousing**
Once processed, data is stored in a structured format for easy querying.

- **Google BigQuery (Cloud Data Warehouse)**:  
  - Stores **processed, structured data**.  
  - Supports **partitioning (by date)** and **clustering (by category)** to improve performance.  
  - Handles **large-scale analytics** with SQL queries.  

---

## **4. Data Transformation**
After storing the data, transformations are applied to prepare it for analytics.

- **dbt (Data Build Tool)**:  
  - Defines transformations using **SQL models**.  
  - Creates **views and tables** in BigQuery for analysis.  
  - Automates **incremental updates** to optimize queries.  

Example:  
- Raw table: **user_clicks_raw**  
- Transformed table: **daily_user_activity_summary**  

---

## **5. Data Visualization**
Now that the data is structured and transformed, it’s ready for reporting.

- **Power BI (Business Intelligence Tool)**:  
  - Connects to **BigQuery** for real-time dashboards.  
  - Creates **two types of visualizations**:  
    1. **Categorical Distribution Graph** (e.g., Top 10 products by sales).  
    2. **Time Series Graph** (e.g., Sales growth over time).  
  - Ensures interactive and easy-to-read dashboards.  

---

## **6. Infrastructure as Code (Automation & Deployment)**
To keep the pipeline scalable and reproducible, infrastructure is automated.

- **Terraform**:  
  - Deploys **GCS, BigQuery, Airflow, dbt, and other resources** with a single script.  
  - Ensures everything is **version-controlled and repeatable**.  

---

## **Final Workflow Summary**
1. **Raw Data** → Stored in **GCS**.  
2. **Airflow DAG** → Triggers **PySpark** processing.  
3. **PySpark** → Cleans and loads data into **BigQuery**.  
4. **dbt** → Transforms data for analytics.  
5. **Power BI** → Visualizes insights for decision-making.
