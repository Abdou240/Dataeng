Here‚Äôs a **detailed explanation** of each step in your **end-to-end data pipeline** using GCP and modern data tools:

---

## **1. Data Ingestion (Batch Processing)**
This is the first step where raw data is collected and stored before processing.

- **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**:  
  - Acts as a **data lake** where raw files (CSV, JSON, Parquet, etc.) are stored.  
  - You can upload data manually or automate it via scripts/API.  

- **Terraform (Infrastructure as Code - IaC)**:  
  - Automates the provisioning of GCP resources like **GCS, BigQuery, and Airflow**.  
  - Ensures infrastructure is reproducible and version-controlled.  

- **Docker (Containerization)**:  
  - Packages applications and dependencies into **containers** for consistency across environments.  
  - Helps deploy Airflow, PySpark jobs, and dbt in an isolated environment.  

- **Apache Airflow (Workflow Orchestration)**:  
  - Manages and schedules batch jobs using **DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs)**.  
  - Defines steps like:  
    1. Extract data from **GCS**.  
    2. Process it using **PySpark**.  
    3. Load it into **BigQuery**.  

---

## **2. Data Processing**
After ingestion, data needs cleaning and transformation before storage.

- **PySpark (Batch Processing Framework)**:  
  - Runs distributed processing for large datasets.  
  - Performs data cleaning, filtering, aggregation, and transformations.  
  - Converts raw data into structured format before loading into BigQuery.  

- **Airflow DAGs (Task Automation)**:  
  - Automates PySpark processing.  
  - Moves processed data from GCS to BigQuery in an **ETL pipeline**.  

---

## **3. Data Warehousing**
Once processed, data is stored in a structured format for easy querying.

- **Google BigQuery (Cloud Data Warehouse)**:  
  - Stores **processed, structured data**.  
  - Supports **partitioning (by date)** and **clustering (by category)** to improve performance.  
  - Handles **large-scale analytics** with SQL queries.  

---

## **4. Data Transformation**
After storing the data, transformations are applied to prepare it for analytics.

- **dbt (Data Build Tool)**:  
  - Defines transformations using **SQL models**.  
  - Creates **views and tables** in BigQuery for analysis.  
  - Automates **incremental updates** to optimize queries.  

Example:  
- Raw table: **user_clicks_raw**  
- Transformed table: **daily_user_activity_summary**  

---

## **5. Data Visualization**
Now that the data is structured and transformed, it‚Äôs ready for reporting.

- **Power BI (Business Intelligence Tool)**:  
  - Connects to **BigQuery** for real-time dashboards.  
  - Creates **two types of visualizations**:  
    1. **Categorical Distribution Graph** (e.g., Top 10 products by sales).  
    2. **Time Series Graph** (e.g., Sales growth over time).  
  - Ensures interactive and easy-to-read dashboards.  

---

## **6. Infrastructure as Code (Automation & Deployment)**
To keep the pipeline scalable and reproducible, infrastructure is automated.

- **Terraform**:  
  - Deploys **GCS, BigQuery, Airflow, dbt, and other resources** with a single script.  
  - Ensures everything is **version-controlled and repeatable**.  

---

## **Final Workflow Summary**
1. **Raw Data** ‚Üí Stored in **GCS**.  
2. **Airflow DAG** ‚Üí Triggers **PySpark** processing.  
3. **PySpark** ‚Üí Cleans and loads data into **BigQuery**.  
4. **dbt** ‚Üí Transforms data for analytics.  
5. **Power BI** ‚Üí Visualizes insights for decision-making.

This **end-to-end pipeline** ensures **automated, scalable, and efficient data processing** using GCP tools.


### **Step 1: Data Ingestion (Batch Processing) - Detailed Breakdown**  
The first step is to **ingest raw data** and store it in a **data lake** for further processing. This step ensures that data is collected, stored securely, and is available for processing in a structured way.

---

## **üìå Objective of This Step**  
We need to collect raw data from a source, store it in **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**, and automate infrastructure deployment using **Terraform**.

---

## **üìÇ Example Use Case: E-commerce Sales Data**  
Let's assume we are working with an **e-commerce dataset** that contains **customer transactions**. The data is generated by the online store daily in CSV format.  
   
**Example raw data file (`sales_data_2025-03-25.csv`)**:  
| Order_ID | Customer_ID | Product | Category | Price | Quantity | Timestamp           |  
|----------|------------|---------|----------|-------|----------|---------------------|  
| 1001     | 500        | Laptop  | Electronics | 1200  | 1        | 2025-03-25 08:30:00 |  
| 1002     | 501        | Phone   | Electronics | 800   | 2        | 2025-03-25 09:00:00 |

## **üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used & Why?**  

| Technology  | Purpose  | How We Use It?  |  
|-------------|----------|----------------|  
| **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)** | Stores raw data | Upload CSV files to a **dedicated bucket** for processing |  
| **Terraform (IaC)** | Automates cloud resource creation | Creates the GCS bucket and IAM roles programmatically |  
| **Docker** | Ensures consistent environment | Runs Airflow in a **containerized setup** |  
| **Apache Airflow** | Orchestrates the pipeline | Automates file ingestion from a local system to GCS |  
| **Bash (Shell Scripting)** | Uploads files programmatically | Automates file transfers to GCS |  

---

## **üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Implementation**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Create Google Cloud Storage (GCS) Bucket**  
Before uploading files, we need a **GCS bucket** to store raw data.

- **Terraform Script to Create GCS Bucket (`gcs.tf`)**:
```hcl
resource "google_storage_bucket" "raw_data_bucket" {
  name     = "ecommerce-raw-data"
  location = "US"
  storage_class = "STANDARD"
}
```
‚úÖ **What this does?**  
- Creates a **GCS bucket** named `"ecommerce-raw-data"`.  
- Sets the **storage class** to `"STANDARD"` for cost efficiency.  

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Upload Data to GCS (Using Bash Script & Airflow)**  
Once the bucket is created, we need to **upload raw CSV files**.

- **Bash Script to Upload Data (`upload_data.sh`)**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
BUCKET_NAME="ecommerce-raw-data"
FILE_PATH="data/sales_data_2025-03-25.csv"

# Upload file to GCS
gsutil cp $FILE_PATH gs://$BUCKET_NAME/raw/
echo "File uploaded successfully to GCS: $BUCKET_NAME"
```
‚úÖ **What this does?**  
- Uses **`gsutil cp`** to copy a local file (`sales_data_2025-03-25.csv`) to GCS.  
- Stores the file inside a `"raw/"` directory in GCS.  

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Automate File Upload with Apache Airflow**  
We don‚Äôt want to manually run the script daily. Instead, we use **Airflow** to automate the process.

- **Airflow DAG to Upload Data (`upload_to_gcs.py`)**:
```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator
from datetime import datetime

# Define default arguments
default_args = {
    'owner': 'airflow',
    'start_date': datetime(2025, 3, 25),
    'retries': 1
}

# Define the DAG
dag = DAG(
    dag_id='upload_sales_data_to_gcs',
    default_args=default_args,
    schedule_interval='@daily',
    catchup=False
)

# Define the task
upload_task = BashOperator(
    task_id='upload_csv_to_gcs',
    bash_command='bash /opt/airflow/scripts/upload_data.sh',
    dag=dag
)

upload_task
```
‚úÖ **What this does?**  
- **Schedules** the upload task to run **daily**.  
- **Triggers the Bash script** (`upload_data.sh`) to copy files to GCS.  

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Verify Data in GCS**  
After execution, check if the file is uploaded:  
```bash
gsutil ls gs://ecommerce-raw-data/raw/
```
üîπ Expected Output:  
```
gs://ecommerce-raw-data/raw/sales_data_2025-03-25.csv
```
---

## **üéØ Summary of Step 1**
‚úîÔ∏è **Created a GCS bucket** for raw data storage using **Terraform**.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Wrote a Bash script** to upload CSV files to **GCS**.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Automated the upload process** using **Apache Airflow DAGs**.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Ensured repeatability** using **Docker** and **Terraform**.
