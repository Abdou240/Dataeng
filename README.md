Here’s a simplified breakdown of your end-to-end data pipeline:  

### **1. Data Ingestion (Batch Processing)**  
- **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)** → Stores raw data.  
- **Terraform** → Provisions infrastructure (GCS, BigQuery, Airflow).  
- **Docker** → Containerizes the pipeline.  
- **Apache Airflow** → Orchestrates batch processing.  

### **2. Data Processing**  
- **PySpark** → Cleans and processes raw data.  
- **Airflow DAG** → Moves processed data to BigQuery.  

### **3. Data Warehousing**  
- **Google BigQuery** → Stores structured, partitioned, and clustered data.  

### **4. Data Transformation**  
- **dbt (Data Build Tool)** → Applies SQL-based transformations on BigQuery.  

### **5. Data Visualization**  
- **Power BI** → Connects to BigQuery and creates dashboards.  

### **6. Infrastructure as Code**  
- **Terraform** → Deploys and manages the infrastructure.  

This structured breakdown ensures clarity while maintaining all key components of your pipeline. Let me know if you need adjustments!
